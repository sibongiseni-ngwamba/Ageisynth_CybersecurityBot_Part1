AegiSynthBot - README FILE
===========================

Project Details:
----------------
1. Project Name: Ageisynth_CybersecurityBot_Part1 (AI Cybersecurity Assistant)
2. .NET Framework: 4.7.2
3. Template: Console App (C# - .NET Framework)

==================
üìò USER GUIDE
==================

Step 1: Running the Application
-------------------------------
- Once you run the application, a greeting will be played using a `.wav` audio file.
- This happens automatically ‚Äî the system looks for `greeting.wav` in the correct folder.
- If the `.wav` file is missing or cannot be found, an error message will be displayed.
- Make sure the audio file is in the root of the project directory (NOT in `bin\Debug`).

Step 2: Displaying the ASCII Logo
---------------------------------
- After the greeting finishes playing, a logo will appear on the console as ASCII art.
- This logo is generated from a `logo.jpg` image.
- If the image is missing or not found, the app will show an error.
- Ensure that `logo.jpg` is also in the root of the project directory.

Step 3: AI Text Greeting
------------------------
- Once the logo is displayed, a text-based greeting message will appear:
  
  ‚û§ "Welcome to AI Cyber Security"

Step 4: Entering Your Username
------------------------------
- The AI will then ask for your **username**.
- This is how the AI will refer to you in the conversation.
- For example, if you type `Steve`, the bot will talk to you like this:
  
  ‚û§ `Steve:-> your question`

Step 5: Starting the Chat
--------------------------
- Now that you're in, the AI will respond to you in a friendly manner using your name.
- You can start asking questions related to cybersecurity.

Step 6: Supported Topics
------------------------
You can ask about these cybersecurity topics:

‚úî Passwords  
‚úî Phishing  
‚úî SQL Injection  
‚úî Malware  
‚úî Cyber Attacks  

üí° You can also ask:
- "how are you"
- "what can I ask about"
- "what is your purpose"

‚ö†Ô∏è These specific phrases have special answers. Please spell them correctly for the AI to understand.

Step 7: Example Interaction
---------------------------
Here‚Äôs a sample interaction between a user and AegiSynthBot:

Steve:-> password
AegiSynthBot:->

Passwords need to be protected and kept safe.

Use strong, unique passwords and enable two-factor authentication.

Never reuse passwords across different sites.

Consider using a password manager for storing your passwords.

Phishing attacks trick users into revealing sensitive information like passwords.

üß† Just type the topic (e.g., "malware" or "sql injection") and the AI will guide you!

Additional Notes:
------------------
üî¥ If you type a question that is NOT in the AI‚Äôs knowledge base, it will let you know that it's trained only on cybersecurity topics.

‚ö†Ô∏è If you press ENTER without typing anything, it will remind you that input is required.

To Exit the Application:
-------------------------
‚úî Simply type: `exit`
