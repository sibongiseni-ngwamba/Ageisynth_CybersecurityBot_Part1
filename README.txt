- "what is your purpose"
- "what can i ask about"
- "who made you"
- "help"
- "how do i exit"

Example Interactions
---------------------

```
You:-> Tell me about password security
AgeisynthBot:-> Make sure to use strong, unique passwords for each account. Aim for at least 12 characters with a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols.

You:-> I'm interested in phishing
AgeisynthBot:-> Great! I'll remember that you're interested in phishing. It's an important aspect of cybersecurity!
Here's something about phishing: Be cautious of emails asking for personal information. Legitimate organizations rarely request sensitive details via email.
```
==================
Advanced Features
==================

Memory and Personalization
---------------------------
- AgeisynthBot remembers your name between sessions
- It can track your interests in specific cybersecurity topics
- You can ask "what do you know about me" or "what do you remember" to see stored information

Sentiment Recognition
----------------------
The bot can detect and respond to different emotional states:
- If you seem worried, it will provide reassurance
- If you're confused, it will simplify explanations
- If you're frustrated, it will offer more patient guidance
- If you're curious, it will encourage your interest
- If you're happy, it will match your enthusiasm

Technical Notes
- User memory is saved to a file called `memory.txt` in the application directory
- The application uses a keyword-matching system to provide relevant responses
- Sentiment detection helps tailor responses to your current emotional state
- Audio greeting uses a `.wav` file that should be placed in the project root directory
- ASCII art logo is generated from a `logo.jpg` image file in the project root directory
- Make sure both media files are in the root directory of the project (NOT in `bin\Debug`)
